# Phase System

The Cross Purpose program guides participants through a structured journey with clearly defined phases. Each phase represents a milestone in the participant's path toward discovering and pursuing their purpose.

## Phase Calculation Logic

The system automatically calculates participant phases based on form submissions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Terminal Phases">
    First checks if participant has completed the program or is no longer pursuing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Re-engagement">
    For NLP status, verifies no coaching forms exist after the NLP form date
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate Progress">
    Checks coaching forms in chronological order to determine current phase
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Database">
    Stores calculated phase in both PostgreSQL and syncs to Salesforce
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Gift Card Triggers

Participants earn gift cards at key milestones:

| Phase | Gift Card Amount | Trigger |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Career Foundations → Career Discovery | $50 | Career Development form submission |
| GED completion | $75 | GED completion documented |
| Career Readiness completion | $75 | Career readiness completion documented |
| Program Complete | $100 | Program Completion form submitted |

**Total Possible**: $225 per participant

## Phase Transitions

### Automatic Transitions
- Interest Form → Onboarding (upon interest form submission)
- Onboarding → Career Foundations (upon all onboarding steps completion)

### Coach-Triggered Transitions
- Career Foundations → Career Discovery (Initial coaching session)
- Career Discovery → GED/Career Readiness (Career Development form)
- Job Readiness → Supervised Job Search (Coaching form submission)
- Supervised Job Search → Program Complete (Program Completion form)
- Any phase → No Longer Pursuing (NLP form submission)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Storage

```typescript
// Current phase stored in User model
model User {
  id           String  @id @default(cuid())
  currentPhase String? @default("Completed Interest Form")
  // ... other fields
}

// Phase calculation handled by PhaseManager
import { PhaseManager } from '@/lib/services/phase-manager';

const phaseManager = new PhaseManager();
const currentPhase = await phaseManager.calculatePhase(userId);
```

### Salesforce Sync

Phase changes automatically sync to Salesforce Contact records:

```typescript
await salesforceService.updateContact(contactId, {
  Program_Phase__c: newPhase,
  Phase_Updated_Date__c: new Date().toISOString()
});
```
